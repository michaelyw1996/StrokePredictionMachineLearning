# StrokePredictionMachineLearning

##  <u> Project description/introduction text (the background information) </u>

The code in this project is attempting to look for the likelyhood of a stroke occuring based on certain bodily factors. This is at its core, a classification problem and three different types of machine learning algorithms will be used on them. I will be using Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistical Regression on the data set to try and get the most accurate prediction that I can get.
