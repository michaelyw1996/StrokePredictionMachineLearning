# StrokePredictionMachineLearning

##  <u> Project description/introduction text (the background information) </u>

The code in this project is attempting to look for the likelyhood of a stroke occuring based on certain bodily factors. This project is at its core, a classification problem and three different types of machine learning algorithms will be used on them. The algorithms used  Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistical Regression on the data set to try and get the most accurate prediction that I can get.
