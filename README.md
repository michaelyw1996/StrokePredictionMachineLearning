# Stroke Prediction Machine Learning

##  <u> Introduction </u>

The code in this project is attempting to look for the likelyhood of a stroke occuring based on certain bodily factors. This project is at its core, a classification task and in order to classify our results, three different types of machine learning algorithms will be used on the data. The algorithms used are Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistical Regression.
